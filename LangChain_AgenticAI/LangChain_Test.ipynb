        "text = 'The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the \"lungs of the Earth,\" is the largest rainforest in the world, covering approximately 5.5 million square kilometers. It spans nine countries in South America, including Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. The Amazon is home to an incredible variety of wildlife, including more than 400 billion individual trees, 2.5 million insect species, and tens of thousands of plant species. Additionally, it houses numerous indigenous tribes, many of whom have lived in harmony with the forest for centuries. However, the Amazon faces significant threats due to deforestation, climate change, and illegal mining. Deforestation alone accounts for the loss of thousands of square kilometers of forest each year, primarily due to agriculture, cattle ranching, and logging. This destruction not only reduces biodiversity but also contributes to global carbon emissions, exacerbating climate change. Protecting the Amazon is critical for maintaining global ecological balance, preserving biodiversity, and combating climate change.'\n"
